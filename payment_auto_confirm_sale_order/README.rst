Configuration
-------------
As ``Administrator``, I go to the form view of a payment method.

I notice a new checkbox ``Automatic Order Confirmation``.

When this box is checked, the sale order will be confirmed automatically when
checking out an order using this payment method.

I adjust the messages for this payment method in regard to this new feature.
