Sale Rental Order Swap Variant
==============================
Constraints
Variant change is not possible if related goods movements have already been confirmed.
If, for example, my item has been delivered and I try to change the variant, I get the following blocking error message:
The variant change cannot be made because the sales order line for the 'article {product.product} is linked to a stock movement that has already been carried out ({reference of stock.move}).
The variant swap can not be done since the sale order line with product {product.product} is linked to a stock move that is already done ({reference of stock.move}).
