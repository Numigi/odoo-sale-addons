MRP Average Cost
================

By default, the official stock module updates the standard_price of a product that has costing_method = 'average' when validating an incoming picking. But the official 'mrp' module doesn't do that when you validate a manufactuging order.

This module adds this feature : when you validate a manufacturing order of a product that has costing method = 'average', the standard_price of the product will be updated by taking into account the standard_price of each raw material and also a number of work hours defined on the BOM.

Together with this module, I recommend the use of my module product_usability, available in the same branch, which contains a backport of the model product.price.history from v8 to v7.
