Stock Usability
===============

The usability enhancements include:
* display the source location on the tree view of the move lines of the pickings (by default, only the destination location is displayed).
* always display the field *Backorder* on the form view of picking (by default, this field is only displayed when it has a value, so the user doesn't know when the field has no value because he doesn't see the field !)
* add a group by Partner in the picking search view (particularly usefull for receptions)
* add graph view for pickings
* remove ability to translate stock.location, stock.location.route and stock.picking.type
