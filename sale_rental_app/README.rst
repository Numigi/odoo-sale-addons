Rented Stocks
-------------
To see a list view of currently rented products, go to ``Rentals / Products / Rented Stocks``, 

.. image:: sale_rental_app/static/description/rented_stock_list.png

The column ``To`` contains the customer instead of the destination location.

Known Issue
~~~~~~~~~~~
The ``Rented Stocks`` view only shows rental operations that are not fully returned.

In case where 2 products of the same type (with different serial numbers)
were shipped together but only one returned, both products would appear in the list view.
