Website Payment Message Enhanced
================================

Context
-------
In Odoo, when the a payment from paypal (or another acquirer) is validated
and the user is back to the Odoo website, until the transaction reaches Odoo,
a misleading message is displayed to the user.

The message says:

..

	We are not able to find your payment, but don't worry.

A few seconds later, the Odoo interface is automatically refreshed and the payment confirmation is shown.

Summary
-------
After installing this module, the message is improved:

	The payment is being processed. Be patient.
